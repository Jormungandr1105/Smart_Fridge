# Smart_Fridge

IED Project for Team Four, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Fall 2019

The objective of this project is to keep households from throwing away food

It functions by:
  1. Taking Temperature, Humidity, and Light Data from the Fridge
  2. Updating our Google Firebase with that information, to pass it to our app
  3. Use the data to warn users if they leave the fridge door open or if the fridge's power fails
  4. Use the data to update the time that food in the fridge is good for.
